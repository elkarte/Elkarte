## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Critical vulnerabilities  

 - Vulnerabilities that may open up sites to attacks are best reported directly by one of the following methods 
   - Sending an eMail to elkarteforum@gmail.com  
   - Sending a personal message to both emanuele and spuds via our support forum at https://www.elkarte.net/community

 - When reporting issues, please be as specific as possible, inclining the version of ElkArte, PHP and SQL you are running and any information about your server/host that may be pertinent.  

 - If you have details on how to reproduce the exploit be sure to provide those step by step details.  

### Non-critical vulnerabilities 

 - These may be reported as regular GitHub issues

 
We'll try to get back to you as swiftly as possible, but keep in mind that this is a volunteer project, as such we can't provide any guarantees about response speed.
