	<strong>Edit Boards</strong><br />
	In this menu you can create/reorder/remove boards, and the categories
	above them. For example, if you had a wide-ranging
	site that offered information on &quot;Sports&quot; and &quot;Cars&quot; and &quot;Music&quot;, these
	would be the top-level Categories you\'d create. Under each of these
	categories you\'d likely want to create hierarchical &quot;sub-categories&quot;,
	or &quot;Boards&quot; for topics within each. It\'s a simple hierarchy, with this structure: <br />
	<ul class="normallist">
		<li>
			<strong>Sports</strong>
			&nbsp;- A &quot;category&quot;
			<ul class="normallist">
				<li>
					<strong>Baseball</strong>
					&nbsp;- A board under the category of &quot;Sports&quot;
					<ul class="normallist">
						<li>
							<strong>Stats</strong>
							&nbsp;- A sub-board under the board of &quot;Baseball&quot;
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><strong>Football</strong>
				&nbsp;- A board under the category of &quot;Sports&quot;</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	Categories allow you to break down the board into broad topics (&quot;Cars,
	&quot;Sports&quot;), and the &quot;Boards&quot; under them are the actual topics under which
	members can post. A user interested in Pintos
	would post a message under &quot;Cars&rarr;Pinto&quot;. Categories allow people to
	quickly find what their interests are: Instead of a &quot;Store&quot; you have
	&quot;Hardware&quot; and &quot;Clothing&quot; stores you can go to. This simplifies your
	search for &quot;pipe joint compound&quot; because you can go to the Hardware
	Store &quot;category&quot; instead of the Clothing Store (where you\'re unlikely
	to find pipe joint compound).<br />
	As noted above, a Board is a key topic underneath a broad category.
	If you want to discuss &quot;Pintos&quot; you\'d go to the &quot;Auto&quot; category and
	jump into the &quot;Pinto&quot; board to post your thoughts in that board.<br />
	Administrative functions for this menu item are to create new boards
	under each category, to reorder them (put &quot;Pinto&quot; behind &quot;Chevy&quot;), or
	to delete the board entirely.';
