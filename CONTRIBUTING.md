     * preferred: ``` git rebase master ```
     * alternatively: ``` git merge master ``` (this may create a merge commit by default)

## Code Reviews

An important and very helpful part of the workflow is code reviews.

The more eyes are on the code, on the PRs, the better: one can always spot something missed, a small detail, a serious bug, or start a conversation on the code that will help in the end reach a better solution for the software.  Part of interacting with a healthy open-source community requires you to be open as well, so *don't get discouraged!* Remember: if changes are suggested to your code, **they care enough about your work that they want to include it!**

Code reviews can be made from the github web interface, or by checking out of the code pulled in locally. You can also test the PRs. Please do, express your objections or approval, fix things or report them.
